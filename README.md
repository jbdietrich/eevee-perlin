Eevee Perlin
=========

A Rust port of @eevee's [implementation](https://eev.ee/blog/2016/05/29/perlin-noise/) of Perlin noise generation. This is a pretty, ah, literal transcription of the Python code in the linked blog post, so it has some rough edges.

Serious noise and/or Rust enthusiasts should probably look at https://github.com/brendanzab/noise-rs instead.
